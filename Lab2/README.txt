Improving the Keyboard reading component by introducing fault handling mechanisms.

Part A - model the process of reading one keyboard key as a DES, Petri Net.
Part B - analyze that Petri net, resorting to the properties studied in the course. Simulate it using an available software package.
Part C - application of the Supervisory Control theory to diagnose and isolate a failure on the system. The failure to detect occurs when the user presses two keys simultaneously. In other words, the main objective of part C consists in designing and implementing a supervisor that detects the multiple keys pressed error and resumes the normal operation of the system.
