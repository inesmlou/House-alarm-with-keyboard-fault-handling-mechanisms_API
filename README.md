# House-alarm-with-keyboard-fault-handling-mechanisms_API
Project for the course Automation of Industrial Processes.

The laboratorial works consist on the implementation of an intrusion detection alarm system, in a restricted space as a single room retail store. The intrusion will be detected resorting to an infrared sensor, installed in such a way that it points towards the main entrance of the space to be protected. A switch is also installed on a window of the aforementioned space.
The Alarm has three main modes of operation, namely OFF, Presence Detector and Active. The three modes are selected by a three positions switch.
Lab 1 focuses on implementing the general functionalities of the alarm, and Lab 2 focuses on introducing fault handling mechanisms for the keyboard component.

Lab 3 is the work developed from a visit to an industrial process, and its modelation as a Petri Net.
